# Student Management System - Java Project

This is a simple Student Management System developed using core Java concepts.  
It is a console-based program that helps to perform student-related operations like managing their basic data, attendance, and subject-wise grades.

I built this project as part of my Java internship assignment. I wrote the full logic manually using only Java standard classes, without using any frameworks or external libraries.

## Project Objective

The main purpose of this system is to maintain a list of students with their:
- ID, name, and course details
- Subject-wise grades
- Attendance record (present/absent per date)
This kind of system is often used in schools and colleges by teachers or admins to keep track of academic performance and attendance of students in a lightweight and manageable way.

## Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- File I/O (Object Serialization)
- Collections: ArrayList, HashMap
- Menu-driven command line interface

## Features Covered

1. Add new student (ID, Name, Course)  
2. View all student records  
3. Search a student by ID  
4. Delete a student by ID  
5. Mark attendance by date  
6. View attendance record  
7. Add subject-wise marks  
8. View student grades  

## How to Run This Project

1. Make sure Java is installed on your system
2. Open the project folder in VS Code or any IDE
3. Compile all `.java` files using terminal

## Run the program:
javac *.java
java Main
